### Functionality

This is the [Custom Enumerables](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables) project, which has me explore yield and the #call methods by creating my own versions of some enumerable methods.

### Thoughts

Was a little hard to remember some of these concepts, since they recently added this lesson to the Ruby curriculum and I had to backtrack to complete it. Wasn't difficult though, and these were indeed great practice for working with blocks and procs! I'm especially grateful, since I felt a bit weak on these concepts. In the original lesson, they just breezed past them but didn't focus on them with any practice exercises.

God bless.
