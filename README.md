# Custom Enumerables
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/custom-enumerables)

### Functionality

This is the [Custom Enumerables](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables) project, which has me explore yield and the #call methods by creating my own versions of some enumerable methods.

### Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
